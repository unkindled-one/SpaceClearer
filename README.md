# Space Clearer

Space Clearer is a GUI made in javafx that allows you to select a directory on their computer and see the biggest files inside it. 
You can then choose to recycle, delete, open, or change directory.

# Note
The recycle option will only work on windows, but the delete option will work on any OS.
The program can also be slow for directories that are very large.
